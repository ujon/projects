## Overview

Timepaw is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our timestamp tracking application.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.**

Timepaw is designed with privacy as a core principle. All timestamp data you create remains exclusively on your device. We do not:

- Collect personal information
- Transmit data to remote servers
- Track your usage or behavior
- Access your location
- Require account registration or login

## Data Storage

All data created in Timepaw is stored locally on your device only. This includes:

- Timestamps
- Any notes or labels you add
- App settings and preferences

**Your data never leaves your device** unless you explicitly choose to export or share it using your device's built-in sharing features.

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party services, including:

- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Crash reporting tools
- Cloud storage services

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device:

- Your data is protected by your device's built-in security features
- We recommend using device encryption and screen lock features
- Backup and restoration of data follows your device's backup settings (e.g., iCloud, local backups)

## Children's Privacy

Timepaw does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The app can be safely used by users of all ages.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any data, there is no personal information for us to:

- Access
- Correct
- Delete
- Export
- Share with third parties

All your data remains under your control on your device.

## Data Deletion

You can delete all app data at any time by:

- Deleting individual timestamps within the app
- Uninstalling the app from your device

This will permanently remove all locally stored data.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
